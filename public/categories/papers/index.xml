      <description>First Thing First  Enigmas of the universe  Cannot be known without a search  &amp;mdash; Epica, Omega (2021)
 In The Rainmaker (1997), the freshly graduated lawyer Rudy Baylor faced off against a giant insurance firm in his debut case, almost getting buried by mountains of case files that the corporate lawyers never expected him to sift through. If only Rudy had a search engine that retrieves all files mentioning suspicious denials and ranks them from most to least relevant, the case prep would&amp;rsquo;ve been a breeze.</description>

      <title>Autocompletion for Search Enginees</title>

      <description>Autocompletion dates back half a century ago (Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Ortony, 1968), initially designed to save keystrokes as people type and help those with physical disabilities type faster. The incomplete user input is the &amp;ldquo;query prefix&amp;rdquo; and suggested ways of extending the prefix into a full query are &amp;ldquo;query completions&amp;rdquo;. This feature is essential to modern text editors and search engines.
 This blog post summarizes key ideas from the survey paper A Survey of Query Auto Completion in Information Retrieval, recommended by my Search teammate at DoorDash.</description>

      <description>Seriously, Read The Ph.D. Grind Everyone doing a Ph.D. or considering doing one should read The Ph.D. Grind. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the much-needed &amp;ldquo;rational optimism&amp;rdquo; for this crazy ride.
I only came across this gem in my final semester year of Ph.D. but Dr. Philip Guo&amp;rsquo;s reflections of his first year in grad school immediately resonated with my own. I, too, procrastinated heavily for the first time in my life and felt I somehow lost my sense of direction.</description>
