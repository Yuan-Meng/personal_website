      <description>Survival was the theme of this past year. When I expressed layoff worries in February 2022 (after Googling consequences of interest rate hikes as an econ noob&amp;hellip;), friends joked that I was a &amp;ldquo;Golden State Worrier&amp;rdquo;. After the chips were down last November, the shock was not one bit absorbed by anticipation. Seeing coworkers I just spoke and worked side by side with disappearing was unreal and painful.

      <description>The thought of my family&amp;rsquo;s graves  Was the only moment  I used to experience true love  That love remains infinite  As I&amp;rsquo;ll never be the man my father is
