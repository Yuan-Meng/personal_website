      <description>See, I spent my teens enraged  Spiralin&#39; in silence  And I armed myself with a grin  &amp;lsquo;Cause I was always the fuckin&amp;rsquo; joker  Buried in their humor  Amongst the white noise  &amp;mdash; Sam Fender, Seventeen Going Under (2021)
 When I was seventeen, it felt like the whole world was going to end. I was probably the only sexual minority in town that I knew of, and the headteacher asked that I stay home so the other kids could be rid of my &amp;ldquo;bad influence.</description>

      <description>Survival was the theme of this past year. When I expressed layoff worries in February 2022 (after Googling consequences of interest rate hikes as an econ noob&amp;hellip;), friends joked that I was a &amp;ldquo;Golden State Worrier&amp;rdquo;. After the chips were down last November, the shock was not one bit absorbed by anticipation. Seeing coworkers I just spoke and worked side by side with disappearing was unreal and painful. Since then I can&amp;rsquo;t quite recall the last time I felt truly exited or relaxed &amp;mdash; I seem to overdo what I can to feel a tiny bit safer.</description>

      <description>The thought of my family&amp;rsquo;s graves  Was the only moment  I used to experience true love  That love remains infinite  As I&amp;rsquo;ll never be the man my father is 
How can you &amp;ldquo;just be yourself&amp;rdquo;  When you don&amp;rsquo;t know who you are?  Stop saying &amp;ldquo;I know how you feel&amp;rdquo;  How could anyone know how another feels?  &amp;mdash; Nightwish, Song of Myself (2011)</description>
