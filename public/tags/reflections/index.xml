      <description>See, I spent my teens enraged  Spiralin&#39; in silence  And I armed myself with a grin  &amp;lsquo;Cause I was always the fuckin&amp;rsquo; joker  Buried in their humor  Amongst the white noise  &amp;mdash; Sam Fender, Seventeen Going Under (2021)

      <description>Survival was the theme of this past year. When I expressed layoff worries in February 2022 (after Googling consequences of interest rate hikes as an econ noob&amp;hellip;), friends joked that I was a &amp;ldquo;Golden State Worrier&amp;rdquo;. After the chips were down last November, the shock was not one bit absorbed by anticipation. Seeing coworkers I just spoke and worked side by side with disappearing was unreal and painful. Since then I can&amp;rsquo;t quite recall the last time I felt truly exited or relaxed &amp;mdash; I seem to overdo what I can to feel a tiny bit safer.</description>

      <description>Seriously, Read The Ph.D. Grind Everyone doing a Ph.D. or considering doing one should read The Ph.D. Grind. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the much-needed &amp;ldquo;rational optimism&amp;rdquo; for this crazy ride.
I only came across this gem in my final semester year of Ph.D. but Dr. Philip Guo&amp;rsquo;s reflections of his first year in grad school immediately resonated with my own. I, too, procrastinated heavily for the first time in my life and felt I somehow lost my sense of direction.</description>

  Resolutions are meant to be broken, but like everything good in life, it&amp;rsquo;s better to try and fail than never to have attempted at all. So here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt for 2022.
1. Be a better modeler 2021 felt quite surreal &amp;mdash; I got my first job offer as a machine learning data scientist, something I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming of for nearly two years. In 2022, I wanna up my ante in the modeling game by working through (a subset of) the following:</description>
