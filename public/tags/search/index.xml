      <description>Autocompletion dates back half a century ago (Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Ortony, 1968), initially designed to save keystrokes as people type and help those with physical disabilities type faster.

This feature is essential to modern text editors and search engines.
 This blog post summarizes key ideas from the survey paper A Survey of Query Auto Completion in Information Retrieval, recommended by my Search teammate at DoorDash.</description>
