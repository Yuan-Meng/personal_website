      <description>Coding interviews can mean different things for &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; software engineers (back-end, front-end, full-stack, etc.) and engineers with a machine learning focus. Apart from LeetCode-style questions, ML engineers (as well as applied scientists, research engineers, and, occasionally, machine learning data scientists) may be asked to implement a classic ML algorithm from scratch during an interview.
This may sound scary if you&amp;rsquo;ve only used libraries to train models without understanding how learning algorithms work under the hood.</description>

      <title>(Quirky) Roadmap for New Grad Data Scientists</title>

      <description>New Grad Timeline Since last November, I regularly get questions about how to get data science jobs. I&amp;rsquo;ve hesitated to give advice because no advice applies to everyone. As more people ask, however, I want to write a post for those in my shoes:
 (PhD) students applying to machine learning or product data scientist roles at tech companies through university recruiting.
 What&amp;rsquo;s special about university recruiting  July to October is high time to start: Some say companies have more headcounts at the beginning of each year &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s just not true for university recruiting.</description>
