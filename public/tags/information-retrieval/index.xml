      <description>Embeddings, Embeddings Everywhere Be it a person, a product, a place, a text, an image, or a planet &amp;mdash; virtually all entities you can think of can be represented as a special kind of vectors, called &amp;ldquo;embeddings.&amp;rdquo; Embedding is a classic idea in mathematical topology and machine learning (click â–¶ for definitions), recently made popular by the rise of foundation models that are exceptionally good at embedding texts, images, and videos to empower downstream use cases, such as embedding-based retrieval, text/image/video understanding, and deep learning rankers with embedding features, to name a few.</description>

      <description>First Thing First  Enigmas of the universe  Cannot be known without a search  &amp;mdash; Epica, Omega (2021)
 In The Rainmaker (1997), the freshly graduated lawyer Rudy Baylor faced off against a giant insurance firm in his debut case, almost getting buried by mountains of case files that the corporate lawyers never expected him to sift through. If only Rudy had a search engine that retrieves all files mentioning suspicious denials and ranks them from most to least relevant, the case prep would&amp;rsquo;ve been a breeze.</description>

      <description>Autocompletion dates back half a century ago (Longuet-Higgins &amp;amp; Ortony, 1968), initially designed to save keystrokes as people type and help those with physical disabilities type faster. The incomplete user input is the &amp;ldquo;query prefix&amp;rdquo; and suggested ways of extending the prefix into a full query are &amp;ldquo;query completions&amp;rdquo;. This feature is essential to modern text editors and search engines.
 This blog post summarizes key ideas from the survey paper A Survey of Query Auto Completion in Information Retrieval, recommended by my Search teammate at DoorDash.</description>
