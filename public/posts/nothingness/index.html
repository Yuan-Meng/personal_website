  <meta name="description" content="Hi, this is Yuan. I&#39;m a Machine Learning Engineer on DoorDash&#39;s Search team, where I work on query understanding and learn to learn to rank... Previously as a Computational Cognitive Scientist, I studied common sense causal and social reasoning in adults and kids, for which I received a Ph.D. from Berkeley. Things I particularly like: Machine learning (ranking, generative models, fairness), cognitively inspired AI, metal guitar, and 🐱. I use 重庆话 when I do mental math.">

<p>Everyone doing a Ph.D. or considering doing one should read <em>The Ph.D. Grind</em>. Don&rsquo;t wait &mdash; you&rsquo;ll learn the much-needed &ldquo;rational optimism&rdquo; for this crazy ride.</p>
<p>I only came across this gem in my final semester year of Ph.D. but Dr. Philip Guo&rsquo;s reflections of his first year in grad school immediately resonated with my own. I, too, procrastinated heavily for the first time in my life and felt I somehow lost my sense of direction. As he put, &ldquo;Having full intellectual freedom was actually a curse, since I was not yet prepared to handle it.&rdquo;</p>
<!-- I only came across this gem in my final semester year of Ph.D. but was immediately captured by Dr. Philip Guo's reflections on his first year at Stanford: 

> *"I procrastinate more than I had ever done in my life thus far: I watched lots of TV shows, took many naps, and wasted countless hours messing around online. Unlike my friends with nine-to-five jobs, there was no boss to look over my shoulder day to day, so I let my mind roam free without any structure in my life [...] Having full intellectual freedom was actually a curse, since I was not yet prepared to handle it."* (p. 16-17)

Or his third year, for that matter:

> *"For most students in my department, nobody would notice or care if they took one day off, so by extension, why not take two days off, a whole week off, or even a whole month off? Therefore, it's unsurprising that many Ph.D. students who drop out do so around their third year."* (p. 37) -->
<!-- I was shocked, not by the seeming "absurdity" (*"Wait what, do Ph.D. students really waste their life away?!"*), but by such honesty --- damn, did someone install a CCTV and watch me during my first three years?  -->
<p>For years on end, I thought I was the only one. I&rsquo;ve kept it a secret out of shame: I don&rsquo;t recall how my early days of grad school went, because I was, more often than not, doing nothing than pushing my research program forward. In my mind, that was infinitely worse than trying one&rsquo;s best but failing. Since I couldn&rsquo;t put words to my struggle, I thought I wasn&rsquo;t worth the help.</p>
<h1 id="doing-nothing-is-a-valid-struggle">Doing Nothing Is A Valid Struggle</h1>
<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t I doing something? I don&rsquo;t know: It&rsquo;s a mystery to me as well. Back in China, I&rsquo;d always been outspoken and hard-working. Cliché  as it may sound, doing computational cognitive science had been my dream job since I was a kid, even before I knew any of the three words. I was enamored with von Neumann&rsquo;s vision that if only we know what thinking entails, we can build machines that think like us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that!&quot;</em> &mdash; von Neumann (1948)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was strange that the moment I arrived at Berkeley, I felt lost. All of a sudden, I became quiet and unmotivated. I went to classes and rushed home. I watched more movies a month than I read papers. Research felt more like a chore than fun.</p>
<p>Was it because I moved to a foreign country and had to read, write, and joke in a second language? Was it because I&rsquo;d never worked with infants and inherited a complex infant study right from the start? Was it because of the casual racism here and there (e.g., being asked to come up with an &ldquo;English name&rdquo;, being told my answer didn&rsquo;t matter in a trivia game with American students when it turned out to be correct&hellip;) that made me feel small? Was it because I felt intimidated by legends who graduated from Berkeley psych and figured I was too far behind?&hellip;</p>
<p>I had no idea. None of those reasons? All of them combined? Now I have no trouble speaking up and know what I&rsquo;m good at (e.g., I&rsquo;m a much better and happier modeler than I am an experimenter). But it took me four years. It took that long because I didn&rsquo;t realize doing nothing is a common response to stress or acknowledge it as a valid struggle, just like trying and failing. I didn&rsquo;t seek help earlier because I thought my pain was an absurd abnormality that no one could empathize with.</p>
<p>To anyone reading this: If you need help from friends, family, fellow students, advisors, other professors, colleagues, therapists, or strangers, please, please ask &mdash; you don&rsquo;t have to justify your reactions to challenges or adversities to feel you&rsquo;re worth their help. As a non-clinical psychologist, I have this wild theory that anything we do makes sense, whether we can articulate it or not: Billions of neurons have coordinated to do what you did, after all. Whether it helps you achieve your goals or makes you happy is a different story. First, acknowledge your natural responses and then you can work towards more adaptive solutions.</p>
<h1 id="1-is-infinitely-better-than-0">1% Is Infinitely Better Than 0%</h1>
<p>2020 was the last year I did nothing. The day before the COVID-19 lockdown (I didn&rsquo;t know there was gonna be one&hellip;), I moved out from my ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s place. A day later, I got an interview from The Data Incubator (TDI), a fellowship program that helps Ph.D. students look for data science jobs. I felt grateful for the timing and was, in Dr. Guo&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;relentlessly focused&rdquo; on the interview preparation (I learned to deploy a fairly simple model for my presentation). I got in, did the thing, added lines on my résumé, learned a few tricks, and made some friends.</p>
<p>What I did at TDI was far less important than the <em>momentum</em> it generated: For the first time in years, I worked daily towards a goal. By contrast, I had the bad habit of only working on projects right before deadlines in my first 3 years. After TDI ended in September 2020, I applied the newly acquired consistency to research.</p>
<p>Apart from a few close friends, I&rsquo;ve never told anyone what happened next (till now): In November 2020, I was informed that my dad was diagnosed with a rare disease; a few days later, my advisor suggested that I quit my Ph.D. because she didn&rsquo;t think I could possibly collect data during the pandemic (I used to work with kids in the lab or museums). To convince her otherwise, I converted my dissertation study from a physical game to a <a href="https://lightbulb-alex.netlify.app/">browser game</a> (nothing fancy, but I had to learn JavaScript from scratch) in about a week. Then from December 2020 to February 2021, I tested about 30 kids over Zoom, which was actually more than I could before the pandemic. After demonstrating Zoom data collection was feasible and having three-way meetings with my advisor and the Head Graduate Advisor, I was allowed to stay.</p>
<p>When my graduation crisis was sort of over in late February 2021, I started looking for summer internships. As context: Major tech companies usually interview students from late August to December for internships that take place next year; interviewing in February for internships the same year is truly in the eleventh hour. I&rsquo;ll spare you the interview details &mdash; maybe I&rsquo;ll write <a href="https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/newgrads/#no-fun-without-friends">another post just about that</a>. From March to May, I applied to any and every internship opening that had the word &ldquo;data&rdquo; or &ldquo;machine&rdquo; in it. During the same period, I was also teaching (missed the deadline for the dissertation 💰) and running experiments. I didn&rsquo;t know how to interview and bombed several great opportunities. I got my first offer in April from a stealth mode startup, which I turned down because of the alarmingly weird vibe. I then got my first legit offer in May. Just to show you how clueless I was: I had my last &ldquo;chat&rdquo; with the VP of Data Science while hiking in the Rocky Mountains, only to realize that was called a &ldquo;behavior interview&rdquo;. It was a miracle I got the job.</p>
<p>From June to August 2021, I had an awesome internship experience: Warm colleagues, a helpful mentor, and a cool project. (I also played more sports than I probably got time for that summer&hellip;) On my last day, a machine learning engineer on my team commented, <em>&ldquo;Yuan, only you can get that much done.&quot;</em> Was that true? I don&rsquo;t know, but I do feel proud for my project. To get it done in time, I planed out each week, did a fair amount each day, and asked for help as soon as I realized I needed it.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hsh1yxtiw9nkpl9/agenda.png?raw=1" width="350"/>
</figure>

<p>In September 2021, I started interviewing for full-time jobs and got my first offer that October. After getting several offers, I started to get questions about how I managed &mdash; after all, the final year of Ph.D. felt like two full-time jobs and the job search was another one on top. The truth is, I still waste time all the time; I&rsquo;m just no longer that 22-year-old kid who&rsquo;d do nothing at all if they couldn&rsquo;t do their best. I&rsquo;ve learned that <strong>doing 1% is infinitely better than doing nothing</strong>.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the laundry list. Here&rsquo;s the TL;DR: Doing nothing is the hardest thing &mdash; you feel you got nothing to say about your struggles and that you&rsquo;re beyond salvation for not trying. You know what, you&rsquo;re hella brave to admit that. Don&rsquo;t be ashamed. Ask for help. Do something, anything, and keep building. Better days are ahead.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="dont-do-it-alone">Don&rsquo;t Do It Alone</h1>
<p>I want to emphasize that I didn&rsquo;t do it alone. I want to thank many friends who lent their hands and ears (and almost money, which I turned down every time). I remember everything &mdash; like when a Texan friend who got an offer ages ago mocked interviewed me past 11 P.M. her time, a Christian friend asked if she could add my dad in her prayers, two DS friends who said I&rsquo;d make a good data scientist long before I got my first internship, and so many more. Make no mistake: I don&rsquo;t think you should lean on anyone to solve your problems or process your emotions &mdash; that is your own work, but you also don&rsquo;t have to keep it all to yourself.</p>
<p>I also thank my therapist from December 2020 to June 2021: By articulating my darkest emotions and internalizing her appreciation of me, I learned not to ridicule but to understand myself. Since then, I suggested therapy to friends who struggled for various reasons. Some said they feel therapists don&rsquo;t care since &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a profession&rdquo; or they can anticipate what therapists are gonna say. When I mentioned these reasons to a clinical psychology Ph.D. friend, she cleverly responded, <em>&ldquo;When you have a flu, do you care if the doctor treats you out of kindness or professionalism? All that matters is that it works.&quot;</em> Your friends are not mental health professionals and can&rsquo;t teach you emotional/social/cognitive coping skills &mdash; you deserve the professional help you need.</p>
