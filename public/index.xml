      <description>Growing up as a shy child, I always felt like an observer of human behavior, an outsider, rather than a participant. Finding GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach on my dad&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf and reading it at a young age gave me a certain comfort, that for all its complexities and paradoxes, the human mind is perhaps understandable through some kind of mathematical formulations. Years later, when Fei came to Beijing Normal University to give a lecture series, I learned for the first time about computational cognitive science that does just that (if you will allow the gross simplification).</description>

      <title>How Could Anyone Know How Another Feels?</title>

      <description>The thought of my family&amp;rsquo;s graves  Was the only moment  I used to experience true love  That love remains infinite  As I&amp;rsquo;ll never be the man my father is 
How can you &amp;ldquo;just be yourself&amp;rdquo;  When you don&amp;rsquo;t know who you are?  Stop saying &amp;ldquo;I know how you feel&amp;rdquo;  How could anyone know how another feels?  &amp;mdash; Nightwish, Song of Myself (2011)</description>

      <title>(Quirky) Roadmap for New Grad Data Scientists</title>
      <link>https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/newgrads/</link>

      <description>New Grad Timeline Since last November, I regularly get questions about how to get data science jobs. I&amp;rsquo;ve hesitated to give advice because no advice applies to everyone. As more people ask, however, I want to write a post for those in my shoes:
 (PhD) students applying to machine learning or product data scientist roles at tech companies through university recruiting.
 What&amp;rsquo;s special about university recruiting  July to October is high time to start: Some say companies have more headcounts at the beginning of each year &amp;mdash; that&amp;rsquo;s just not true for university recruiting.</description>

      <title>The Ph.D. Grind: Doing Nothing Is the Hardest Thing</title>

      <description>Seriously, Read The Ph.D. Grind Everyone doing a Ph.D. or considering doing one should read The Ph.D. Grind. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the much-needed &amp;ldquo;rational optimism&amp;rdquo; for this crazy ride.
I only came across this gem in my final semester year of Ph.D. but was immediately captured by Dr. Philip Guo&amp;rsquo;s reflections on his first year at Stanford:
 &amp;ldquo;I procrastinate more than I had ever done in my life thus far: I watched lots of TV shows, took many naps, and wasted countless hours messing around online.</description>

      <title>Set Up Python Environment for CogSci 131</title>
      <link>https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/python_env/</link>

      <description>CogSci 131 (Computational Modeling of Cognition) is one of my favorite classes at Berkeley when I took it with Prof. Tom Griffiths in 2016. Now I&amp;rsquo;m teaching it in my last semester. Before getting to the fun parts (e.g., implementing recurrent nets and classic RL algorithms like SARSA using vanilla NumPy), one needs to set up the right Python environment. I hope this tutorial can save students some headaches.
Option #1: Conda Virtual Environment To avoid nightmares down the lineðŸ‘‡, use virtual environments for your local stuff.</description>

      <description>Piled Higher and Deeper: https://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1670
  Resolutions are meant to be broken, but like everything good in life, it&amp;rsquo;s better to try and fail than never to have attempted at all. So here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt for 2022.
1. Be a better modeler 2021 felt quite surreal &amp;mdash; I got my first job offer as a machine learning data scientist, something I&amp;rsquo;d been dreaming of for nearly two years. In 2022, I wanna up my ante in the modeling game by working through (a subset of) the following:</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Setup for Zoom Guitar Lessons</title>
      <link>https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/guitar/</link>

      <description>Goals + Overview (macOS) I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking guitar lessons over Zoom since the pandemic. As an electric player, I initially found it challenging to split audio inputs/outputs multiple ways:
 Input #1: Microphone &amp;ndash; so I can talk to my teacher Input #2: Guitar &amp;ndash; no need to explain ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤Ÿ :) Output #1: Headphone &amp;ndash; so I hear guitar effects created by my amp simulator Output #2: Zoom &amp;ndash; so my teacher hears the same effects, not just dry signals  After some research, I found a setup that feels simple and intuitive to me.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Data Science</title>

      <description>What do you see? ðŸ‘€
 You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking, &amp;ldquo;The red block stopped, right after which the green block started to move coincidentally.&amp;quot;
Nice try&amp;hellip; I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking, &amp;ldquo;The red block made the green one move&amp;rdquo;.
Why Ask Why? We can&amp;rsquo;t help but think about causation Your stats professor can say &amp;ldquo;correlation is not causation&amp;rdquo; like a broken record, but we can&amp;rsquo;t help but think about causation. Even 12-month-old babies don&amp;rsquo;t think the motions of the two blocks are merely correlated.</description>

      <description>This paper collection reflects some of the most exiting trends in computational cognitive science and cognitively inspired AI, in my opinion.
 Overview How can AI and cognitive science shed light on each other&amp;rsquo;s biggest challenges?

      <title>Choosing Metrics</title>
      <link>https://www.yuan-meng.com/posts/metrics/</link>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Tis the college and job application season of the year. If only schools and companies have crystal balls to see into each candidate&amp;rsquo;s future achievements, they need not interview people; since they do not have such things, SAT scores, GPA, internships, and other quantifiable metrics are used to aid decisions. Simplified metrics are by no means ideal â€” As Goodhart put it (often paraphrased), &amp;ldquo;When a measure becomes a metric, it ceases to be a good measure.</description>
