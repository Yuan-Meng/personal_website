> See, I spent my teens enraged <br/> Spiralin' in silence <br/> And I armed myself with a grin <br/> 'Cause I was always the fuckin' joker <br/> Buried in their humor <br/> Amongst the white noise <br/> --- Sam Fender, [*Seventeen Going Under*](https://open.spotify.com/track/5rF6YUIlgiat22OT1lWspJ?si=9a83e243ded34c2b) (2021)

When I was seventeen, it felt like the world was going to end. I was probably the only sexual minority in town that I knew of, and the headteacher asked that I stay home so the other kids could be rid of my "bad influence." Also back then, never in a million years had I thought of one day turning my intellectual curiosity about what "learning" entails into a career (be it cognitive science or machine learning). Still, I fought for every opportunity that might yield some ambiguous reward someday, not knowing where it would lead — be it undergraduate research, graduate school applications, job interviews, or something else.

People joke about rock stars dying young — I thought I was gonna join the "[27 Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club)," if not earlier. My life far from perfect, yet I've made friends with whom I could be myself and traveled places where I felt calm, inspired, or mesmerized. People say age is just a number, which is only partially true --- we all die before X years old --- this number isn't just a symbol, but truly brings us biologically closer to the end. I'm mindful of this ultimatum, but getting more comfortable seeking what I carve --- be it knowledge, love, or wonders, I shall steer myself there.

> You have brains in your head <br/> You have feet in your shoes <br/> You can steer yourself any direction you choose <br/> --- Dr. Seuss, *[Oh, the Places You'll Go!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh,_the_Places_You%27ll_Go!)*
