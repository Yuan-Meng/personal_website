Survival seems to be *the* theme of this past year. When I expressed layoff worries in February 2022 (after Googling consequences of interest rate hikes as an econ noob...), friends were joking that I was a "Golden State Worrier". After the chips were down last November, the shock was not one bit absorbed by anticipation. Seeing coworkers I just spoke or even worked side by side with disappearing was unreal and painful. I can't quite recall the last time I felt truly exited or relaxed --- it seems I overdo what I can to feel a tiny bit safer. 

It makes sense --- as a friend once said, we wouldn't have survived as strangers in a strange land if we didn't stay vigilant every step along the way. And missing out on exiting stuff seems much less consequential than overlooking what matters to our survival --- or so I thought, until I recently came across *Engineer's Survival Guide*:

> I used to panic and start thinking about the worst possible outcome to make sure I was prepared. Looking  back, I missed many opportunities because I was acting on fear instead of excitement. [...] Why is being exited about a situation so important? Because it opens you up on instead of closing you down. [...] When we are exited, we start having fun with what we are doing. 

Strangely the last year of grad school, I was in a much worse position than where I am right now --- I didn't know if I was gonna graduate or or find a job at all, yet I was so exited to learn everything I could lay my hands on about machine learning. First day of internship, I was thrown a big hairy graph problem --- I knew nothing about graph neural nets back then and had never worked with massive amounts of graph data, but instead of fear, I was ingenuously curious to understand how relationships could be encoded and what model architectures make that possible. I spent loads of time reading about tangentially related papers/blogposts and can probably do the same project in half of the time now, but I'll never trade the excitement I had for the fear and pressure to perform. 

Maybe the tunnel vision I have right now is exactly what I need to survive in desperate times, but desperate times will one day be over --- when it does, I hope there is still excitement and curiosity left of me.
