The future is now <br/> Now I'm disappearing <br/><br/>--- The Offspring, *The Future Is Now* (2012)

When I was 19, all I wanted was to be a cognitive scientist, to understand how it is that from the chaos of our brain emerged thoughts, concepts, and consciousness. Right when I was applying to graduate school, DeepMind's AlphaGo had just started making rounds in tech news, and there had never been a more exciting time for cognitively inspired AI... that is, up until the LLM frenzy now.

10 years later the future is here, yet I forgot what truly exited me --- somewhere along the PhD grind, I traded curiosity for "publish or perish". I sometimes envy friends still in grad school, because the future of science is in your hands now. Easy as it may be for me to say: Even if all your experiments fail, you'd still have a job, but the joy of discovery is only now.  

I wish I could take my own advice... Last 10 months as a data scientist, I also start to sense my excitement for ML fading, overtaken by the pressure to perform --- and layoff fears. The daily tasks and deadlines that have occupied my time have also occupied my mind. Apart from getting things done, I seem to have forgotten what I used to love, whom I used to love, and maybe even who I used to be. The tunnel vision may be exactly what I/we need to survive in desperate times, but desperate times will one day be over --- when it does, I wonder what will be left of me. 

To end on a slightly more optimistic note --- my biggest birthday wish (besides survival...) is to "daydream" more about who I want to be for when the good days come.
