I don't remember my friend's exact words --- she said something along the lines of "the greatest pain is someone's indifference to your pain". 

My dad's been dying, for a year and a half now. The family friends who told me --- I know that they care, but I know that they don't know how I feel. And I don't expect them to. The same goes for friends I made later in life. 

I had only hoped for one person to understand, in the very beginning. Boy, that went well. When they told me about a death in their family, I couldn't relate, but as the AI that I was (am?), I asked/read around to choose what to say and do. I wanted to help, but didn't want to "cheer up" someone from grieving. I did what I could. Then a few months later, when I told them about my dad's disease, I got "I'm in a happy place now, sorry I don't feel anything." I had no idea if that was normal or fucking cold (or maybe the two aren't mutually exclusive). I talked to an evolutionary anthropology friend (whose advisor wrote [*Survival of the Friendliest*](https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Friendliest-Understanding-Rediscovering-Humanity/dp/0399590668)) about empathy. Is it necessary that we know how another feels? And is it even possible? I recall that we seemed to agree, even when we can't mentally simulate another person's feelings, it doesn't mean we don't care or can't do anything for them. It's the actions we take that count.

I've been suppressing my feelings so well that I only feel a vague sense of anxiety most of the time, rather than pain. I have to --- no one was gonna do my interviews or can write my dissertation for me. I've kept working as I used to, if not harder. Sometimes guilt would wash over me --- "How can I keep 'business as usual'?" "Why am I not suffering from my dad's pain?" But then I'd come to realize, I can't save my dad's life by destroying my own life. I'm not helping anybody by suffering. I'm not heartless for not feeling my dad's pain --- I can't and I don't have to. It will be the actions I take that count. I don't know what yet.
